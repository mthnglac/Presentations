== Single-command or Multi-command ==


* With oclif you can create 2 different CLI types: single and multi.


=== Single-command ===

* Single CLIs are like `ls` or `curl`.

* They can accept args & flags.

{{{typescript

  import {Command} from '@oclif/command'
  export class GoodbyeCommand extends Command {
    async run() {
      console.log('goodbye, world!')
    }
  }

}}}


=== Multi-command ===

* Multi CLIs are like `git` or `heroku`.

* They have subcommands that are themselves single CLIs

* Sample structure:

  package.json
  src/
  └── commands/
      ├── create.ts
      └── destroy.ts
