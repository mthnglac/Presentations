== What is Oclif? ==


=== Introduction ===

* Oclif is a framework for building CLIs in Node.

* It's designed to be extensible so that you can easily add plugins such as
the update warning plugin or build your own for users to install at runtime.

* It has a generator that allows us to create necessary project files.

* It requires very few runtime dependencies.

* Everything customizable (flag parser, help generation optional).


=== Requirements ===

* Only Active LTS Node versions are supported.
